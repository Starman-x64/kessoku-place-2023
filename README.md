# kessoku-place-2023
Detailing the events of the Kessoku Band faction in r/place 2023.


## brain dump
- scrollable, interactive timeline (probably vertical)
- might be cool to have the canvas in the background which changes depending on far you scroll down.
- plus an additional page with the events document form
- add page to generate event json files to push into the main branch (maybe?)
- could use discord as an interface for adding events

## Naming Conventions
Event and chapter files are named by the following convention:
```yyyy-mm-dd_hh-mm_name-of-event-or-chapter.json```
For example:
```2023-07-26_05-39_test-chapter.json```
```2023-07-26_05-42_test-event-2.json```
Times are in UTC-7.
